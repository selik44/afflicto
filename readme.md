# multi-store
- views can be overriden per-store, using the view method of the Controller class. The default views are the ones used by 123friluft


# Architecture
- Figure out a way to cache routes while still allowing translated routes. (@see gentlefox.net routing)
- Move complicated controller logic to commands, for extendability?
- Move all closure routes to controllers, so we can cache routes.
- Architecture: Requests, Events, Commands etc.
- Caching: Implement caching, look at varnish cache? memcached?
- figure out a better way to organize translation lines
